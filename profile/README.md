## Who we are
We are an Australian Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Network with over 2.7 million registered players and over 40 thousand new ones joining us each week! <br/>
The team is made up of around 20 people, coming from all around the world: America, India, Russia, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, Belgium..

## What we do

- We strive to optimize code for a sometimes horrible programming language to do something it was definitely not intended to do
- We try to make as many projects as reasonable available through the public. At least veryone can benefit from our hours of depression.
- Using Java, C++, Go and Rust to build modular and fast projects that run on our network
- Using PHPStan (maximum level) on all of our projects to find issues before they ever occur!
