## Who we are
We are an international Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server with over 2.7 million registered players and over 40 thousand new ones joining us each week! <br/>
The development team is made up of around 20 people, coming from all around the world: America, India, Russia, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, Belgium etc. <br/>
Most of us are between 16 and 22 years old, and we use NetherGames to expand our experience while building something awesome.

## What we do

- We strive to optimize code for a sometimes horrible programming language to do something it was definitely not intended to do (PHP)
- We try to make as many projects as reasonable available to the public. At least veryone can benefit from our hours of depression.
- Using Java, C++, Go and Rust to build modular and fast projects that run on our network
- Using PHPStan (maximum level) on all of our projects to find issues before they ever occur!
